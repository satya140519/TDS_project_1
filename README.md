I used the python Requests library  for sending HTTP requests to do the Api call in Github. After I got the files users and repositories, i do most of the data analysis using the pandas library in python.I do some of the analysis in Excel also.
The most interesting thing I got from the analysis is, when i tried to see the relation between the length of the bio users wrote to the number of followers he has. In my analysis i used the regression slope to find the relation.
And the values turns out to be roughly 48, that for every extra word of length 48 followers will increase.But after seeing the data i think that it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that writing longer bios causes an increase in followers. Other factors  could also influence follower counts.
